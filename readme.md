Personal scripts for solving logic quizzes

## Convex hull
This folder contains a script that, given a set of points, calculates the convex hull using the Graham's Scan algorithm

## Islands
This folder contains a script that, given a matrix of `1` and `0`, calculates the number of island present in the map.
An island is a set of `1` one next to the other, where "next" means that they share at least one border (up, down, lef,
right).

## Operators Placement
`1□2□3□4□5□6□7□8□9□10=11` COMBINATIONS.  
There are 2^9 = 512 ways in which we can fill the squares with + , −.  How many ways would make the equation true?  
Note: You are not allowed to use parenthesis.  
This folder contains a script that computes the solution to this question.
